**Monetary Policy Transmission, Central Bank Digital Currency, and Bank Market Power** [Draft coming soon]<br />
Joint with [Matthias HÃ¤nsel](https://www.hhs.se/en/persons/h/hansel-matthias-emmanuel/) and [Hiep Nguyen](https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N19-1602)

Interest rates on new central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be expected to enter the monetary policy toolkit soon. Using an extended Sidrauski (1967) model featuring an oligopolistic banking sector, we study the complex transmission of CBDC rate adjustments, which generally involve both direct and indirect effects. This is because a CBDC rate cut does not only affect the rate on the CBDC itself, but also induces the non-competitive deposit providers to adjust their spreads, as the new substitute for their products becomes relatively less attractive. A calibration exercise suggests that the indirect effects depend strongly on deposit market concentration and could provide substantial real effects even in a scenario with limited CBDC adoption. Our framework also yields insights on the transmission of interest on reserves and optimal monetary policy in the presence of CBDC and bank market power.
