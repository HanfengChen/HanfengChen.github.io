[**Unveiling the Interplay between Central Bank Digital Currency and Bank Deposits**](../assets/papers/interplay_cbdc_deposits.pdf) <br />

*Abstract*: We analyze the risks to financial stability following the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as the household's source of liquidity. We revisit the result in the existing literature regarding the equivalence of payment systems by considering different degrees of substitutability between payment instruments and introducing a collateral constraint that banks must respect when borrowing from the central bank. When CBDC and deposits are perfect substitutes, the central bank can offer loans to banks that render the introduction of CBDC neutral to the real economy. Hence, there is no effect on financial stability. However, when CBDC and deposits are imperfect substitutes, the central bank cannot make the bank indifferent to the competition from CBDC. It follows that the introduction of CBDC has real effects on the economy. Our dynamic analysis shows that an increase in CBDC demand leads to a drop in bank profits but does not raise significant concerns about CBDC crowding out deposits. <br />

[**Monetary Policy Transmission, Central Bank Digital Currency, and Bank Market Power**](../assets/papers/mp_cbdc_bankpower.pdf) <br /> 
Joint with [Matthias HÃ¤nsel](https://www.hhs.se/en/persons/h/hansel-matthias-emmanuel/) and [Hiep Nguyen](https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N19-1602) [[Slides](../assets/papers/mp_cbdc_bankpower_slides.pdf)] <br /> 

*Abstract*: Interest rates on new central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be expected to enter the monetary policy toolkit soon. Using an extended Sidrauski (1967) model featuring an oligopolistic banking sector, we study the complex transmission of CBDC rate adjustments, which generally involve both direct and indirect effects. This is because a CBDC rate cut does not only affect the rate on the CBDC itself, but also induces the non-competitive deposit providers to adjust their spreads, as the new substitute for their products becomes relatively less attractive. A calibration exercise suggests that the indirect effects depend strongly on deposit market concentration and could provide substantial real effects even in a scenario with limited CBDC adoption. Our framework also yields insights into the transmission of interest on reserves and optimal monetary policy in the presence of CBDC and bank market power. <br />
