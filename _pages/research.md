[**Unveiling the Interplay between Central Bank Digital Currency and Bank Deposits**](../assets/papers/CBDC_CF.pdf) (with [Maria Elena Filippin](https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N20-1155)) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10359) <br /> 

We extend the Real Business Cycle model in Niepelt (2022) to analyze the risk to financial stability following the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDC competes with commercial bank deposits as households' source of liquidity. We consider different degrees of substitutability between payment instruments and review the equivalence result in Niepelt (2022) by introducing a collateral constraint banks must respect when borrowing from the central bank. When CBDC and deposits are perfect substitutes, the central bank can offer loans to banks that render the introduction of CBDC neutral to the real economy. We show that the optimal level of the central bank's lending rate depends on the restrictiveness of the collateral constraint: the tighter it is, the lower the loan rate the central bank needs to post. However, when CBDC and deposits are imperfect substitutes, the central bank cannot make banks indifferent to the competition from CBDC. It follows that the introduction of CBDC has real effects on the economy.

## Work in progress

**Monetary Policy Transmission, Central Bank Digital Currency, and Bank Market Power** (with [Matthias HÃ¤nsel](https://www.hhs.se/en/persons/h/hansel-matthias-emmanuel/) and [Hiep Nguyen](https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N19-1602)) [Draft coming soon] <br /> 

Interest rates on new central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be expected to enter the monetary policy toolkit soon. Using an extended Sidrauski (1967) model featuring an oligopolistic banking sector, we study the complex transmission of CBDC rate adjustments, which generally involve both direct and indirect effects. This is because a CBDC rate cut does not only affect the rate on the CBDC itself, but also induces the non-competitive deposit providers to adjust their spreads, as the new substitute for their products becomes relatively less attractive. A calibration exercise suggests that the indirect effects depend strongly on deposit market concentration and could provide substantial real effects even in a scenario with limited CBDC adoption. Our framework also yields insights on the transmission of interest on reserves and optimal monetary policy in the presence of CBDC and bank market power.
