# Welcome!
<img src="/assets/images/w5_g_pNa.jpeg" align="right" alt="Profile picture" class="inline" style="width:30%;padding-left:5%;">


I am a PhD student in economics at [Uppsala University](https://www.nek.uu.se/?languageId=1) and I work as an economist at the [National Institute of Economic Research](https://www.konj.se/english.html). I am also affiliated with the Center for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability ([CeMoF](https://www.su.se/center-for-monetary-policy-and-financial-stability/)) at Stockholm Univeristy.


## Research
My research focuses on macroeconomics, with particular interest in monetary policy, market power, and (non)bank financial intermediation.
